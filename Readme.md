# ZIO-Toolbox
### A collection of useful tools to work with ZIO application

This projects is a collection of useful tools to work with ZIO application. It is a work in progress so it is not published, not even in RC version.
It focuses on Doobie utils and on Tracing utilities based on [ZIO-OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/zio/zio-telemetry/tree/series/2.x/opentelemetry/src).

### Modules:
- `doobie`: Provides a standard layer to get a `Transactor` and `Flyway` migrations.
- `tracing-commons`: Shared utilities to initialize the application so that Tracing and Logging are available
- `tracing-doobie`: instrumentation around the execution of doobie fragments
- `tracing-sttp`: instrumentation around the execution of http requests on the client side (using sttp) or on the server side (using http4s)
- `tracing-grpc`: instrumentation around the execution of grpc requests on the client side and server side (using [zio-grpc](https://github.com/scalapb/zio-grpc))
- `tracing-kafka`: instrumentation around zio-kafka producer and consumer

### Simple Example
A simple example application is available at `modules/simple-example`. Run `docker-compose up` from that directory. It provides the observability stack (Grafana Tempo, Grafana Loki) + the application stack (Kafka, Postgres).
The collection of logs in Loki doesn't fully work yet, but the traces in Tempo are working fine.

### Real World Example
A more real world example is available in `modules/example` directory, where you will find 3 services that can be run independently.  the `http-calls/calls.http` file contains the calls to start and stop sessions targeting the charging service.
For my experiments I'm using Datadog which provides seamless integration between logs and traces, but there is work in progress to have this setup working with Grafana/Loki.
